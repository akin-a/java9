# JShell

- An interactive tool for learning the Java programming language and prototyping Java code.
- JShell is a Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL), which evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions as they are entered and immediately shows the results.
- The tool is run from the command line.
- Open cmd (in a system where java 9+ installed) and run "jshell" - thats it, simple, now go on , code :)
- By default, 10 basic imports are involved.
- We can write one liners, piece of code to run, methods, class etc to run
- Can add extra imports if required.
